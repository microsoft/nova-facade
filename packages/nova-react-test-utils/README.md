# nova-react-test-utils

The Nova Facade is a set of interfaces that represent the core framework dependencies of a data-backed UI component in a large application. This allows high value components to be written in a host agnostic fashion and used within any host that implements the Nova contracts.

This package provides test utilities for components written with the React specific implementation.
