# nova-types

The Nova Facade is a set of interfaces that represent the core framework dependencies of a data-backed UI component in a large application. This allows high value components to be written in a host agnostic fashion and used within any host that implements the Nova contracts.

This Types package contains the core contracts and the sister package @nova/react provides a React specific implementation of the contexts etc required to make the host implementations accessible to the Nova component code.
