/**
 * Describes the commanding contract a Nova component can expect to be provided by the host application. Refer to the equally
 * named React hooks provided by the `@nova/react-facade` package for their functional details.
 *
 * TODO This contract needs to be redesigned to:
 * - support a common contract but distributed command definitions
 * - decouple command triggering from layout information
 *
 * The current version is functional for a small number of users, but will not scale, and blurs the boundaries of responsibility
 * between the command triggerer and the host framework (which should be responsible for establishing how the user's intent is
 * expressed within the larger system).
