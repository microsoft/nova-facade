/**
 * Describes the GraphQL contract a Nova component can expect to be provided by the host application. Refer to the equally
 * named React hooks provided by the `@nova/react-facade` package for their functional details.
 *
 * The type used to annotate a GraphQL document is left opaque. It is up to the host to know what type this is at
 * runtime and to treat it accordingly. Refer to the `graphql` function provided by the `@nova/react-facade` package
 * for more details.
 *
 * In case the host application uses Apollo Client, these hooks can be provided by using the
 * `@graphitation/apollo-react-relay-duct-tape` package. See https://github.com/microsoft/graphitation for details.
