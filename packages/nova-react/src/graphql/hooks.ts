/**
 * Executes a GraphQL query.
 *
 * This hook is called 'lazy' as it is used to fetch a GraphQL query _during_ render. This hook can trigger multiple
 * round trips, one for loading and one for resolving.
 *
 * @see {useFragment} This function largely follows the documentation of `useFragment`, except that this is a root of a
 *                    GraphQL operation and thus does not take in any props such as opaque fragment references.
 *
 * @example
 ```typescript
 import { graphql, useLazyLoadQuery } from "@nova-facade/react";
 import { SomeReactComponent, fragment as SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType } from "./SomeReactComponent";
 import { SomeRootReactComponentQuery } from "./__generated__/SomeRootReactComponentQuery.graphql";

 const query = graphql`
   query SomeRootReactComponentQuery {
     someGraphQLType {
       ...SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType
     }
   }
   ${SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType}
 `;

 export const SomeRootReactComponent: React.FC = () => {
   const result = useLazyLoadQuery<SomeRootReactComponentQuery>(query);
   if (result.error) {
     throw result.error;
   } else if (!result.data) {
     // Loading
     return null;
   }

   return (
     <SomeReactComponent someGraphQLType={result.data.someGraphQLType} />
   );
 };
 ```
 *
 * @param query The query operation to perform.
 * @param variables Object containing the variable values to fetch the query. These variables need to match GraphQL
 *                  variables declared inside the query.
 * @param options Options passed on to the underlying implementation.
 * @returns An object with either an error, the result data, or neither while loading.

/**
 * A first-class way for an individual component to express its direct data requirements using GraphQL. The fragment
 * should select all the fields that the component directly uses in its rendering or needs to pass to external
 * functions. It should *not* select data that its children need, unless those children are intended to remain their
 * pure React props as data inputs.
 *
 * For children that *do* have their own data requirements expressed using GraphQL, the fragment should ensure to
 * spread in the child's fragment.
 *
 * For each fragment defined using the `graphql` tagged template function, the Nova graphql-compiler will emit
 * TypeScript typings that correspond to the selected fields and referenced child component fragments. These typings
 * live in files in the sibling `./__generated__/` directory and are called after the fragment name. The compiler will
 * enforce some constraints about the fragment name, such that it starts with the name of the file it is defined in
 * (i.e. the name of the component) and ends with the name of the fragment reference prop that this component takes in
 * (which typically will be named after the GraphQL type that the fragment is defined on).
 *
 * The typing that has a `$key` suffix is meant to be used for the opaque fragment reference prop, whereas the typing
 * without a suffix describes the actual data and is only meant for usage internally to the file. When the opaque
 * fragment reference prop is passed to a `useFragment` call, the returned data will be unmasked and be typed according
 * to the typing without a suffix. As such, the unmasked typing is only ever needed when extracting pieces of the
 * component to the file scope. For functions extracted to different files, however, you should type those separately
 * and *not* use the emitted typings.
 *
 * @example
 ```typescript
 import { graphql, useFragment } from "@nova-facade/react";
 import { SomeChildReactComponent, fragment as SomeChildReactComponent_someGraphQLType } from "./SomeChildReactComponent";
 import { SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType$key } from "./__generated__/SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType.graphql";

 export const fragment = graphql`
   fragment SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType on SomeGraphQLType {
     someDataThatThisComponentNeeds
     ...SomeChildReactComponent_someGraphQLType
   }
   ${SomeChildReactComponent_someGraphQLType}
 `;

 export interface SomeReactComponentProps {
   someGraphQLType: SomeReactComponent_someGraphQLType$key;
 }

 export const SomeReactComponent: React.FunctionComponent<SomeReactComponentProps> = props => {
   const someGraphQLType = useFragment(fragment, props.someGraphQLType);
   return (
     <div>
       <span>{someGraphQLType.someDataThatThisComponentNeeds}</span>
       <SomeChildReactComponent someGraphQLType={someGraphQLType} />
     </div>
   );
 }
 ```
 *
 * @todo For now, the fragment objects should be exported such that parent's can interpolate them into their own
 *       GraphQL documents. This may change in the future when/if we entirely switch to static compilation and will
 *       allow us to also move the usage of the graphql tagged template function inline at the `useFragment` call-site.
 *
 * @note If the host does not provide a `useFragment` implementation, the data is simply unmasked at compile-time but
 *       otherwise passed through from the parent at run-time.
 *
 * @param fragmentInput The GraphQL fragment document created using the `graphql` tagged template function.
 * @param fragmentRef The opaque fragment reference passed in by a parent component that has spread in this component's
 *                    fragment.
 * @returns The data corresponding to the field selections.
