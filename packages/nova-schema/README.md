# nova-schema

The Nova Facade is a set of interfaces that represent the core framework dependencies of a data-backed UI component in a large application. This allows high value components to be written in a host agnostic fashion and used within any host that implements the Nova contracts.

This Schema package contains the GraphQL schema definitions that help with declaring data dependencies of high value components.
